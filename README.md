## Project Overview

This project is a simple Notes application consisting of a backend API and a frontend interface (optional), fully containerized using Docker and Docker Compose.

The backend is a Node.js/Express server connected to a MySQL database container. The application allows users to create, read, and delete notes with persistent storage managed through Docker volumes.

The goal was to demonstrate containerization of a full-stack app, multi-container orchestration, and persistent data management with Docker.

---

## Technologies Used

- **Node.js & Express.js** - Backend API development
- **MySQL 8.0** - Relational database for notes storage
- **Docker** - Containerization of the backend and database
- **Docker Compose** - Orchestrating multi-container environment
- **curl** - Command line tool to test API endpoints
- **HTML/CSS/JS** (optional) - Frontend user interface (if implemented)

## Architecture

```plaintext
+-----------------+          +-------------------+
|  Frontend (UI)  | <------> |  Backend API      |
|  (optional)     |          |  Node.js + Express|
+-----------------+          +-------------------+
                                   |
                                   |
                           +-------------------+
                           |  MySQL Database   |
                           |  (Docker Container)|
                           +-------------------+

Each component runs in its own Docker container and communicates over a Docker network.

---

## Setup Instructions

### Prerequisites

* Docker installed: [Get Docker](https://docs.docker.com/get-docker/)
* Docker Compose installed (usually comes with Docker Desktop)

---

### Clone the repository

```bash
git clone https://github.com/yourusername/virtual-project.git
cd virtual-project
```

---

### Build and Run Containers

Run the following command to build Docker images and start the containers:

```bash
docker-compose up --build
```

This command will:

* Pull MySQL Docker image and create a database container
* Build the backend Node.js app image from the Dockerfile
* Start both containers, exposing ports:

  * MySQL: 3306 (mapped to host)
  * Backend API: 5000 (mapped to host)

---

## Using the Application

### Accessing the Backend API

You can interact with the backend API using `curl` or Postman.

Example: Get all notes

```bash
curl http://localhost:5000/api/notes
```

Expected response:

```json
[
  {
    "id": 1,
    "content": "Hi there"
  }
]
```

### Adding Notes

Use a POST request (with Postman or curl) to add notes (if implemented).

Example:

```bash
curl -X POST http://localhost:5000/api/notes -H "Content-Type: application/json" -d '{"content": "New note content"}'
```

---

## Persistence and Data Storage

* The MySQL container uses Docker volumes to store data on the host.
* This ensures notes data persists even if the containers are stopped or removed.
* Volume defined in `docker-compose.yml`:

```yaml
volumes:
  notes_data:
```

---

## API Endpoints

| Method | Endpoint         | Description         |
| ------ | ---------------- | ------------------- |
| GET    | `/api/notes`     | Retrieve all notes  |
| POST   | `/api/notes`     | Create a new note   |
| DELETE | `/api/notes/:id` | Delete a note by ID |

*(Add any other endpoints you implemented)*

## Troubleshooting

* **Port already in use error:**
  Make sure no other service is using ports 3306 or 5000 on your host machine.
* **Database connection errors:**
  Ensure MySQL container is running and environment variables match.
* **Container fails to build:**
  Check Dockerfile and docker-compose.yml syntax.

---

## Future Enhancements

* Add full frontend UI to create, view, and delete notes
* Implement user authentication
* Add data validation and error handling
* Deploy the app on a cloud provider using container orchestration (Kubernetes, AWS ECS, etc.)

Thank you for reviewing the project!

Would you like me to generate the screenshots or terminal output examples for you? Or help with adding a simple frontend UI next?
